## Overview

Nowcasting is often defined as the prediction of the present, the very near future and the very recent past. 

rjd3nowcasting provides helps to operationalize the process of nowcasting. It can be used to specify and estimate Dynamic Factor Models. 
Recent version of the package also includes news analysis. The way the package was conceived is inspired by the [GUI add-in](https://github.com/nbbrd/jdemetra-nowcasting) developed for JDemetra+ V2.

## Installation

Running rjd3 packages requires **Java 17 or higher**. How to set up such a configuration in R is explained [here](https://jdemetra-new-documentation.netlify.app/#Rconfig)


### Latest release

To get the current stable version (from the latest release):

- From GitHub:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rjdverse/rjd3toolkit@*release")
remotes::install_github("rjdverse/rjd3nowcasting@*release", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

- From [r-universe](https://rjdverse.r-universe.dev/rjd3nowcasting):

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rjd3nowcasting", repos = c("https://rjdverse.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```


### Development version

You can install the development version of **rjd3nowcasting** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rjdverse/rjd3nowcasting")
```


## Usage

```{r loading-library}
library("rjd3nowcasting")
```

Once the package is loaded, there are four steps to follow:

1. Import data 
2. Create or update the model 
3. Estimate the model 
4. Get results

Detailed information concerning each step can be found in the vignette.
   
### 1. Input

```{r input}
data("data0", "data1")
data0_ts<-ts(data0[,-1], start=c(2012,1), frequency = 12)
data1_ts<-ts(data1[,-1], start=c(2012,1), frequency = 12)
```

### 2. Create or update the model

```{r model}
### Create a model from scratch
ns<-ncol(data0_ts)
types<-c("M","M","Q","YoY","YoY","M","M","YoY","YoY","YoY")
loadings1<-matrix(data=TRUE, ns, 2)
#loadings2<-matrix(data=c(rep(TRUE,ns+5),rep(FALSE,5)), ns, 2)
dfm0_init <- create_model(nfactors=2,
                          nlags=2,
                          factors_type = types,
                          factors_loading = loadings1,
                          var_init = "Unconditional")

### Update an existing model
est0 <- estimate_em(dfm0_init, data0_ts) # cfr. next step
dfm1_init <- est0$dfm # R object (list) to save from one time to another 
# or, equivalently,
# dfm1_init <- create_model(nfactors=2,
#                           nlags=2,
#                           factors_type = types,
#                           factors_loading = loadings1,
#                           var_init = "Unconditional",
#                           var_coefficients = est0$dfm$var_coefficients,
#                           var_errors_variance = est0$dfm$var_errors_variance,
#                           measurement_coefficients = est0$dfm$measurement_coefficients,
#                           measurement_errors_variance = est0$dfm$measurement_errors_variance)
```

### 3. Estimate the model

```{r estimation}
est0 <- estimate_ml(dfm0_init, data0_ts)
# or est0<-estimate_em(dfm0_init, data0_ts)
# or est0<-estimate_pca(dfm0_init, data0_ts) # to be avoided unless you only have monthly data 
```

### 4. Get results

#### Model and forecasts

```{r results}
rslt0 <- get_results(est0)
print(rslt0)

fcsts0 <- get_forecasts(est0, n_fcst = 3)
print(fcsts0)
plot(fcsts0, series_name = "FR_PVI")
# Note: impact of Covid-19 on the model estimate could be eliminated by treating affected indicators as missing data during this period. This has not been done in this example. 
```

#### News analysis

```{r news}
news1 <- get_news(est0, data1_ts, target_series = "FR_PVI", n_fcst = 3)
news1$impacts
news1$forecasts
plot(news1)
```
